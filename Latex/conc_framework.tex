\subsubsection{OpenMP vs. cilk}
By trying out the two frameworks we came to the following conclusion:

Cilk is the easier of the two to add simple parallelization to a recursive program. Programs that do not have a recursive structure are harder to parallelize effectively, because the iterative structure has to be rewritten. 

OpenMP is our framework of choice for everything else, because it provides control structures for parallelizing recursive and iterative programs, as well as better control over the scheduling of tasks and other variables of the parallelization.
