The experimental estimation for which out FFT becomes faster than the trivial DFT algorithm.

Our FFT is faster from the beginning on.

Here is a comparison of Jupiter's and Saturn's performance of our iterative FFT. We did not include the recursive versions, since it is ways slower after \(2^{14}\) numbers.

Jupiter's of course faster. It got better CPUs. We used this information for our speedup plots later at our parallelism problem solutions.
