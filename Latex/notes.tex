We did 100 repetitions and took the median as 'average' speedup, since bad and slow testcases sometimes completely destroyed the result. \newline 
We only show speedup graphs between \(2^{15}\)\ and \(2^{25}\) input numbers. That is the interval with the most interesting changes. Before that interval, there is not much difference between our core experiments and afterwards testcases took too long. We believe we got the most important information in this interval.\newline
We expect the speedup to be approximately linear. We also expect MPI to deliver the best parallel performance, because we can exaclty control what the cores have to do.
